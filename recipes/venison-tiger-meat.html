        <h2>Chef's Notes</h2>

        <p>Here is a quick and easy appetizer recipe
            that only takes several minutes to complete. This
            recipe is perfect for game nights and what i like to 
            call "bar food".</p>
            <p>    
            I will list the ingredients below followed by a 
            step by step guide on prepairing the dish.</p>

        <h3>ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. raw ground meat</li>
            <li>1 raw egg</li>
            <li>4 drops of tabasco sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of finely diced onion</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp. cayenne pepper</li>
            <li> crackers and bread for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preperation</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a bowl and 
                thoroughly mix with your hands</li>
            <li>Place in an airtight bag and refrigerate
                for 8 hours</li>
            <li>Eat with crackers and bread. If serving at 
                a party, place the tiger meat in a bowl that sits 
                in an ice bath (see feature image).</li>
            <li>If you do not eat it all within two days,
                then cook it with eggs or hashbrowns for 
                breakfast</li>            
        </ol>
