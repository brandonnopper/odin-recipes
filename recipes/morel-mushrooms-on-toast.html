        <h2>Chef's Notes</h2>

        <p>This <em>recipe</em> takes a few pointers from the 
            British dish Welsh rarebit, but with a couple 
            tweaks to make the cheese spread less 
            overpowering. Normally, I would reach for 
            sharp cheddar for just about any occasion, but 
            less is more in this recipe.</p>

        <p>The same applies for the beer portion. 
            Traditional Welsh rarebit recipes often call 
            for stout or strong ale, but I find that 
            darker beers made the cheese sauce too bitter. 
            Mild cheddar and light beer offer a good 
            compromise with the delicate flavor of morel 
            mushrooms. Garnish these mushroom toasts with 
            fresh parsley or chive.</p>

        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. fresh morel mushrooms</li>
            <li>¾ cup light beer, heated</li>
            <li>5 tbsp. butter, plus extra</li>
            <li>3 tbsp. flour</li>
            <li>1 large shallot, minced</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups coarsely shredded mild white cheddar</li>
            <li>2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>½ tsp. ground mustard</li>
            <li>Minced fresh parsley, to taste</li>
            <li>4-6 large slices of crusty bread</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preperation</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>If needed, slice larger morel mushrooms 
                into smaller pieces. In a medium saucepan 
                over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons 
                of butter. Add mushrooms and cook until 
                softened and most of the moisture has 
                evaporated, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Add minced shallot with a generous pinch 
                of salt and sauté for additional minute. 
                Transfer cooked mushrooms to a bowl, 
                scraping as much shallot out of the 
                saucepan as possible.</li> 
            <li>Lower heat to medium and melt remaining 
                3 tablespoons of butter in the saucepan. 
                Add flour and whisk for 2 minutes. Turn 
                heat down to low and slowly whisk in ¾ cup 
                of hot beer to form a roux.</li> 
            <li>Next, stir in 1½ cups of grated cheddar 
                until fully melted and incorporated to 
                form a thick paste—add a splash more beer 
                if needed. Season with Worcestershire 
                sauce and ground mustard. Take off heat.</li>  
            <li>Spread butter on one side of each slice 
                of bread, and toast until golden around 
                the edges. Remove bread from oven and 
                spread beer-cheese spread onto each slice 
                and pile with sautéed morel mushrooms.</li>
            <li>If you like, sprinkle remaining grated cheddar 
                cheese on top. Broil until cheese is melted and 
                mushroom edges look slightly toasted. Season 
                toasts with salt and pepper to taste, garnish 
                with fresh parsley, and serve immediately.</li>                
        </ol>
