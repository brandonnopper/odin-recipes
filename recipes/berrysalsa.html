        <h2>Chef's Notes</h2>

        <p>Berries are not exactly what comes to mind when you 
            think of salsa. But they make an excellent summer chip 
            dip that is savory and sweet and packs a bonus punch 
            of antioxidants, fiber, and vitamin C.</p>

        <p>I suggest making a double batch of this berry salsa 
            because while it goes well with tortilla chips, it’s 
            also excellent with seafood. Grill up a halibut 
            fillet and pile this fresh mixture on top. It's 
            freakishly good on butter-seared salmon and scallops 
            as well. You really don’t have to worry about 
            seasoning the fish, just lightly dust with salt and 
            pepper. If seafood isn’t your jam but wild game is, 
            this salsa is amazing on venison, quail, pheasant, 
            wild boar, and bear meat.</p>  

        <p>Please note that this salsa doesn’t really get better 
            with age, so I recommend serving within an hour of 
            mixing. If you have leftovers, pair it with seafood 
            or wild game the next day. Wait any longer and the 
            berries will get a bit too soggy and the texture of 
            the salsa will change.</p>
